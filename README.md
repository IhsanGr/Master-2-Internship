**EEG-based person identification**  
This project aims to perform multi-class classification on EEG data to accurately assign each sample to its corresponding class, representing the subject's identity. The goal is to address privacy concerns in the metaverse, as VR headsets technology is gaining the capability to record EEG data. Various experiments have been conducted to identify the most effective method for user recognition based on brain waves. This project raises several important questions and opens the door for further research and improvements. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at : ihsan.grichi@gmail.com.  
The dataset used throughout this project comes from : Dreyer, P., Roc, A., Pillette, L. et al. A large EEG database with usersâ€™ profile information for motor imagery brain-computer interface research. Sci Data 10, 580 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02445-z
