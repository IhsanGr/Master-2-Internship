**MI_BCI_Anonymizing_data.ipynb** : Correspond to a possible improvement of the project by anonymizing the data with the method developped on the following article : L. Meng, X. Jiang, J. Huang, W. Li, H. Luo and D. Wu, User Identity Protection in EEG-Based Brainâ€“Computer Interfaces, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, vol. 31, pp. 3576-3586, 2023, doi: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3310883.

**MI_BCI_Enhancement_Feature_extraction.ipynb** : Correspond to the feature extraction of processed EEG signals.

**MI_BCI_Enhancement_ML_Algorithms.ipynb** : Correspond to the multi-class classification of processed EEG signals.

**MI_BCI_Feature_extraction.ipynb** : Correspond to the feature extraction of raw EEG signals.

**MI_BCI_ML_Algorithms.ipynb** : Correspond to the multi-class classification of raw EEG signals.

**MI_BCI_Retrieve_process_data.ipynb** : This script was used to reorder the several signals processed with the HAPPE pipeline Gabard-Durnam Laurel J. , Mendez Leal Adriana S. , Wilkinson Carol L. , Levin April R. "The Harvard Automated Processing Pipeline for Electroencephalography (HAPPE): Standardized Processing Software for Developmental and High-Artifact Data", Frontiers in Neuroscience, vol. 12 (2018), doi : 10.3389/fnins.2018.00097

**gdf_to_set.m** : This script has been used for data formatation since EEGLab and HAPPE pipeline are not designed to manipulate .gdf format. This matlab scripts transform EEG signals in .gdf format to EEG signals in .set format
